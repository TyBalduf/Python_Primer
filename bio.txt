Linus Pauling (February 28, 1901- August 19, 1994)*, the only person who has won two undivided Nobel Prizes,
was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of a pharmacist, Henry H.W. Pauling, and Lucy (Darling) Pauling.
He attended Washington High School in Portland but because of a technicality did not receive his diploma until 1962,
long after he had received his bachelorâ€™s degree from Oregon State College in 1922, his doctorate from the
California Institute of Technology in 1925, and honorary degrees from universities in seven countries.
